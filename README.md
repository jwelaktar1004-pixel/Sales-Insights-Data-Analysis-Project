💼 Sales Insights Data Analysis Project | Real-World Business Dashboard

I recently completed a real-world Sales Insights Data Analysis project where I analyzed company-wide sales performance using SQL and Power BI to uncover key business insights and trends.

This project focuses on transforming raw SQL data into an interactive Power BI dashboard that tracks Revenue, Profit Margin, and Sales Quantity across various markets, regions, products, and customer types — enabling data-driven decision-making for business growth.
